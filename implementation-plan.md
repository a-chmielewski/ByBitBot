Main building process is done. Any new changes to any module should be listed here:

### Market Analysis Tool Implementation - Done
- Added new `market_analyzer.py` module in the `modules/` directory
- Created `MarketAnalyzer` class that fetches OHLCV data for multiple symbols and timeframes
- Integrated market analysis into bot startup sequence in `bot.py`
- Added market analysis configuration section to `config.json` with symbol list (BTCUSDT, DOGEUSDT, ETHUSDT, MNTUSDT, NXPCUSDT, PEPEUSDT, SOLUSDT, SUIUSDT, TONUSDT, XRPUSDT) and timeframes (1m, 5m)
- ~~Implemented placeholder market type detection algorithm that will be enhanced later~~
- **ENHANCED:** Implemented comprehensive algorithmic market type classification system
- Created `test_market_analyzer.py` for independent testing of the market analysis functionality
- Market analyzer runs automatically on bot startup and displays formatted analysis results to console

### Comprehensive Market Type Recognition Algorithms - Done
- Implemented full technical analysis-based market classification system
- Added calculation of required technical indicators: ADX, +DI/-DI, ATR (multiple periods), Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages
- Implemented 5 market type classifications: TRENDING, RANGING, HIGH_VOLATILITY, LOW_VOLATILITY, TRANSITIONAL
- Different parameter sets for 1-minute and 5-minute timeframes as specified
- Hierarchical classification logic: High-Vol → Low-Vol → Trending → Ranging → Transitional
- Enhanced console output with ADX values, analysis reasons, and detailed market type explanations
- Market analysis now provides comprehensive technical analysis details for each symbol/timeframe combination

### Bug Fixes and Improvements - Done
- **Symbol Format Fix**: Updated PEPEUSDT to 1000PEPEUSDT in config.json to match ByBit's actual symbol format
- **Symbol Validation**: Added pre-validation of symbols before analysis to prevent invalid symbol errors
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error handling in market analyzer with INVALID_SYMBOL classification
- **Timestamp Safeguards**: Added safeguards in exchange module to prevent unreasonable timestamps (>5min offset)
- **Rate Limiting**: Increased delay between API requests from 0.1s to 0.2s to reduce rate limit issues
- **Robust Analysis**: Market analyzer now gracefully handles invalid symbols and continues with valid ones

### Strategy Selection Enhancement - Done
- **Market Type Tags**: Added MARKET_TYPE_TAGS to strategy template for indicating optimal market conditions
- **Strategy Visibility Control**: Added SHOW_IN_SELECTION flag to hide development/example strategies
- **Enhanced Strategy Display**: Strategy selection now shows market type tags for better strategy matching
- **Tag Implementation**: Added [TEST] tag to DoubleEMAStochOsc and [TRANSITIONAL] tag to BreakoutAndRetest
- **Example Strategy Hidden**: StrategyExample no longer appears in selection menu

### Dynamic Top Volume Symbol Selection - Done
- **Exchange API Enhancement**: Added fetch_all_tickers() and get_top_volume_symbols() methods to ExchangeConnector
- **Market Analyzer Enhancement**: Added dynamic symbol selection based on 24h volume rankings from ByBit
- **Configuration Options**: Added use_dynamic_symbols, top_volume_count, and min_volume_usdt settings
- **Fallback System**: Robust fallback to static symbol list if dynamic fetching fails
- **Real-time Volume Data**: Bot now analyzes current top 10 highest volume coins (min $5M USDT volume)
- **Improved Market Coverage**: Dynamic selection captures trending meme coins and high-activity markets automatically

### Dynamic Strategy Configuration - Done
- **Removed Hardcoded Parameters**: Eliminated fixed symbol/timeframe assignments from strategies
- **Interactive Symbol Selection**: Users select from analyzed symbols with market type context display
- **Interactive Timeframe Selection**: Users choose timeframe with current market conditions and prices
- **Market-Aware Interface**: Shows market types (TRENDING, RANGING, etc.) for informed decision making
- **Enhanced User Flow**: Strategy → Symbol → Timeframe → Trading Loop progression
- **Future-Proof Design**: Any strategy can work with any analyzed symbol and timeframe combination
- **Context-Rich Display**: Symbol selection shows market conditions for both 1m and 5m timeframes

### Periodic Market Condition Monitoring - Done
- **Silent Market Analysis**: Runs market analysis every 60 minutes without verbose output to check current conditions
- **Strategy Compatibility Checking**: Compares current market type with strategy's MARKET_TYPE_TAGS to detect mismatches
- **Automated Mismatch Detection**: Identifies when market conditions change (e.g., TRANSITIONAL → TRENDING) and no longer match strategy
- **User Notification System**: Alerts user with full market analysis when mismatch is detected
- **Strategy Reselection Flow**: Prompts user to either continue with current strategy or select new one based on updated market conditions
- **Graceful Bot Management**: Handles strategy changes by cleanly shutting down and prompting for manual restart
- **Adaptive Trading Logic**: Ensures strategy remains aligned with market conditions throughout trading session
- **Testing Flexibility**: Includes commented option to reduce check interval to 30 seconds for testing purposes
